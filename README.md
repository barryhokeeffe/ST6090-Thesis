Supervisors: Dr Andrea Vistentin; Dr Diego Carraro

The goals of this thesis are:

1. Create an automated tool to collect data from API and scrape data from web resources.
2. Integrate the machine learning design framework (the data, the models, the results) with the analysis of the econometric (empirical and theoretical).
3. Provide a sound and comprehensive modern machine learning framework that stands out from the statistical approaches proposed so far (more models, experiments’ methodology in line with modern machine learning’s principles).
4. Investigate explainability techniques such as SHAP and LIME
